/***********************************************
NOTES
************************************************/

/***IN GENERAL***/

//Notes on Chained Methods: 

 -Typically pass the selection to reference the element they just acted on
 -Order Matters


//Semicolon: Ends the 'chain of code' so to speak, at least so long
as we're focusing on chained methods


//Label Positioning: text will sit on top of elements you expect it to be contained within, by default. For example a horizontal bar chart would by default have its labels sitting on the top margin or 'left-side' of the bar. You would have to position it downward for it to fall within the area of the bar.

//Anyonymous functions: Typically they exist purely to 'retun' a value. Things like datasets can't be operated on until they are delivered in a form that .js can understand, such as the result of a function. This is what makes things like data available for functions/methods to act upon

//The "g" svg element: An invisible "group" element They're used to:
-Contain or "group" other elements
-You can apply transformations to them, which affect how visual elements are rendered

/**************MISC***********************************/

//.call() Takes the current selection and makes it available as an input to a function


/**************IMPORTING AND BINDING DATA*************/

//.csv("path",function(error,data)): 

function(error,data): Any anonymous function, aka a placeholder function
that in this case only exists to return a result, so we can do programming on it.
'Takes data and makes it actionable, so to speak.'

-This function only 'executes', aka data only appears after source
data has loaded.
-All functions that rely on your data are called within function(data)
anonymous fucntion.
-Error is built in condition for if data didn't load properly

//.select()

Typically fed a CSS selector, it will search
the page and select the first DOM element that your selector matches

//.selectAll("selector")

Selects all given selector, or creates an 
empty selection for it if it doesn't exist yet in the chain.

//.data()

Parses the output of your anonymous function declared in .csv() into
a useable dataset.

Now that it's parsed, the data can be looped through by methods farther
down the chain

When called, creates the anonymous function function(d). After .data() is
called, you can use d as an input to any function later in the chain that acts on 
your original imported dataset.

Similarly to function(error,data), it exists purely to return your parsed data as the 'result'
of a function, as many methods down the chain can take functions as arguments but 
not simply datasets.

d corresponds to the element the program is currently working on, often
changes rapidly as code loops through data

//.enter() 

Enters your newly parsed data into the present selection, in many 
examples an empty selection.

//.append()

Appends given element (ie. CSS selector, svg element)
to the selection you specified in .select()

AND makes that newly appended element the "selected element"

/**************GENERAL MARKUP**************/

//.text(): Inserts your specified string within the tags of your
selected element

//.style("css attribute","value")

Set CSS property

Assigns in-element styling when applied an HTML element

//.attr("html attribute","value"):

Set HTML property

//.classed("class name",/*true or false*/)

true assigns the given class
flase removes it

//"alignment-baseline" property

http://bit.ly/218PnJq


/**************SCALING**********************/

//.scale() specifies that you're defining a scale, followed typically by a scale type method, such as .linear()

//.domain([min,max]) the minimum an maximum values of your input data

//.range([min,max]) the minimum and maximum values of your output range

//.max(dataset,dataset reference) identifies max value in reference

//.min(dataset,dataset reference) identifies minimum value in reference

//.nice() applied as a link in the chain after .range(), rounds your domain down to the nearest round value

//.rangeRound() Use instead of .range(), rounds output values ot hte nearest whole number. Avoids fuzzy edges on the web

//.clamp() Call .clamp(true) to ensure that no values are returned outside of the specified range

/**************AXES*************************/

//.d3.svg.axis() Sets up a generic axis function

//.scale(/*Scale variable you want the axis to reflect) Tells the axis function which scale it should refer to

//.orient() Tells labels where to go relative to the axes e.g. "left", "right", "bottom"

/**************ARRAYS***********************/

//.push(value)

Appends given value to the end of the array it's chained to
