DaSL Marketing Plan Kickoff - 5.16.2016


Julie:
-Can use this as a way to differentiate ourselves in proposals
-She would not bill creative services, but CTC or IEG ...
-This can help us improve our company wide project managment capability

From Creative Services:

Internal marketing, they'll need 
- Slides from David
- These slides would inform the development of a slipsheet
- SRBI can make some use of this, perhaps

Business development
- Good for proposals
- This is the argument for divisions to be spending on the marketing component

Next Steps:

Send Julie:
-Create Julie an account and send her URL
-Send her the slides
-Any writeups you might have

Other Next steps:
-Begin to socialize it with projects
-We'll wait for Dave to write up SOPs before we go to Mark Spranca for marketing money
- Julie will put together next steps for socializing this internally and using it to make us look good for proposals


How Marketing goes in general of internal products
-Divisions are reponsible for any marketing of anything
-Means we would have to get some divisions on board for marketing this
